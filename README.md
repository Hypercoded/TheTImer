# TheTimer


This is a program I decided to make for my YouTube channel, in which there's a timer that starts at exactly 24 hours. The timer will tick down, but if people interact with a video on my channel, then the timer gains extra time. The goal os for people to interact with the video enough to the point where the timer doesn't hit 0, because if it does, the video will be deleted and the timer will say "The timer is dead."


Currently, it's a bit late and I can't write up detailed instructions on how to set it up yourself, but soon I'll add some instractions.

Just know that this is just a way for people to see how the prgram works.

Also, app.py and main.py are running on 2 different machines.

app.py is on Heroku, and currently main.py is on my PC, but soon I'll migrate to Azure.
